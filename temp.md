Here is the temporary file that will allow you to **follow the evolution of the project**.

first, by personal choice 
the app is **tested in JS, HTML & CSS** exclusively for the time I agree with myself to create the UI of the app and thus be able to modify it more easily.

For the moment, I intend to do this type of UI, see images, but nothing sure.
The goal is to give me a taste of what **Tetranize** should look like tomorrow..
